# Tic-Tac-Toe
This is my grade 11 computer science project, where I made Tic Tac Toe. It can be a two player game or single player, where you can verse against my unbeatable code.

My code effectively uses a control flow to procced the user through the game. The main elements to the program are loops, methods, and global variables.

How To Play:
Its just plain old tic tact toe. For any input you must use the console. At the start you can choose single or two player. 
For single player, you can choose three levels (easy, medium, and hard). The hard level, is unbeatable. You can only tie or lose to the computer. This is achived, since there only a limited amount of moves the player can make, so I have generalized the player's moves and programed the best consequent move for the comptuer to make. When it's your turn you can use the console to input your move. For two player you can input your names, adn take turn making your move.
